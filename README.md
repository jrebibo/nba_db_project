CS 4750 - Semester Project Information
Description:
During the course of the semester, you will be expected to complete a project involving
the creation of a database-related system. You will be provided a MySQL database
account and web space that will be PHP enabled on CS servers. The project will entail
the design of a database, with all accompanying evidence of its good design, along with
a front-end application (this does not have to be a website) that will interface with the
database through record gathering, inserting, deleting, etc. The project must be
complex enough so that it is not a trivial exercise, but cannot be so complex as to take
longer than one month of effort.

Project Group:
A project group should consist of four (4) or five (5) students. Individuals, pairs, or
groups of three will not be permitted. However, working individually is possible if your
circumstances do not permit you to be available on Grounds to work with your team.
(Please discuss your situation with me first if this applies to you.) Members of the teams
will be expected to do more than individuals and will be graded accordingly.

Project Assignment:
A team of four (4) or five (5) members are required to work on a pre-approved project.
The goal of this project is to design, implement, populate, test, and document a
database of your choosing. The database can be for a situation and domain of your
choosing. The project should not be trivial, nor should it be so ambitious that you
cannot complete it in approximately two monthsâ€™ time.
Components of the Project:
    + A database that you create in MySQL (all groups will set up their database on our MySQL server - no exceptions) that is populated with relevant data; and
    + A well-designed application to interface with your database - this can be a standalone or web application - that is relevant to the "world" that you created your database for.

The final project document should include the following:
    + Requirements Document (including a complete description of the "world" to be modeled in your database with a discussion of who might use your database);
    + Explanation of design decisions that you made in creating your application (i.e. why did you choose the type of app you implemented, why did you use that language, if your database should be secure, did you secure it and how, anything interesting or relevant, etc.);
    + A description of your testing procedures for both the database and application;
    + An E-R diagram;
    + Database schema including integrity constraints;
    + Proof that your database is in BCNF, 3NF, or other normal form;
    + Sample data and sample queries from your application; and
    + For team projects, a candid evaluation by each member of his/her contribution as well as the contributions of all other members.

Grading Rubric:
Note: You can request a certain browser for me to grade your project with, a Mozillavariant, an IE-variant, Opera, or Chrome.
75% of your project grade will be for the database and application and 25% for the documentation. To get full credit for the database and application, your database should be well designed (and proven so in the documentation) with enough relevant data to show that it does work properly. The application should be well-designed, free from technical errors, thoroughly tested, and should be good enough that, if this were a real-life project, you would be proud to turn it in to your boss. (i.e. doing little things to
make your project stand out from the others is a good thing.) 

To get full credit for the documentation, it should be grammatically correct, contain all essential information, and your train of thought in developing the application should be apparent.
